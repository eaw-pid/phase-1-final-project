# Phase 1 Final Project
Core Deliverables:
As a user, I can:
•	Search for breweries using the ‘Search’ form to find breweries by State and get a list of breweries from that state
•	Search for breweries using the 'Dropdown' form to find breweries by type and get a list of breweries of that type
•	Click on a brewery name and see the brewery information (including url link, address and phone number) populated in the "About the Brewery" section

A search can either be conducted using the dropdown OR the search bar.

A user will not get accurate results if they first start their search using the searchbar and then use the dropdown. 

The user must refresh the page if they want to switch between search tools.
