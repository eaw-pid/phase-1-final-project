# Phase 1 Final Project
Core Deliverables:
As a user, I can:
•	Search for breweries using the ‘Search’ form to find breweries by State and get a list of breweries
•	Search for breweries using the 'Dropdown' form to find breweries by type and get a list of those breweries
•	Click on a brewery name and see the brewery information (including url link, address and phone number) populated in the About the Brewery section
